Players reach [[Sorceronhold]], a holy city with a fortified citadel-temple. As surviving dragons flee to the city, [[the Eldritch Conclave]] has seized the opportunity created by the power vacuum and declared their rule over the dragonkind. The have banned [[The Temple of First Creation]] from entrance, so that mortals cannot enter the halls too small for dragons to enter and hide under its thick walls.

[[The Dawn Siblings]], predicting that [[Sorceronhold]] becomes a temporary region center for dragons to gather, have set in motion second part of their plan to set an explosion in this city as well.
# Entrance
The city is currently receiving refuges gathering from everywhere. Players enter the city while noticing their old captor [[Dralenthis]] flying in and hitting an old gate tower, causing a few rocks to fall down. Players have an opportunity to react and save people from certain death (Acrobatics DC 12 or Perception DC 14).

[[Myra]] will lead players to a tavern, that is held by her sister [[Laelia]]. While heading there, party may encounter several events.

In the tavern, they will learn that [[the Dawn Siblings]] has been very active in the past weeks, which is not a good sign. They will also learn news of the current city state.

[[Laelia]] will ask for help to retake [[The Temple of First Creation]] in order to harbor people there.
## Wise Stoner
A stoner has pieced all together during a trip. Nobody pays attention to them, but they preach on the streets. They noticed that dragons gathered for the festival and the explosion followed, and now dragons gather again.
>The stoner preacher, his eyes glazed yet piercing, draws a deep breath from his hand-rolled joint. "Man, have you noticed? Dragons gather, then things go 'boom'. They're gathering again in Sorceronhold. It's all a cosmic cycle, dude. Watch out, because history's about to replay, and I ain't waiting for the encore."
## The Dragon Egg Cart
Players might notice a cart with suspicious folk coming through the street crowd. With enough perception (DC 16), they will notice those are dragon eggs.
## Gambaridze
Either in the tavern or before, players will meet a minor deity of trickery and lore. They will be interested to hear a story of grand trickery from the players. If satisfied, they reveal answer one of the PCs questions. If not, they reveal one of the characters secrets to others in a cryptic manner. After giving the information, they disappear in thin air.

They have a very peculiar way of saying thing, ranging from laughing to a dead serious interest.
# Temple Fight
## Preparation
Players will be able to find good in the city for the fight, if needed.

In terms of intelligence, they might use their existing connection to find information like temple plan or who is guarding it.
