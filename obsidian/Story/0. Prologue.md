All heroes are prisoners, led to their doom by a dragon captor. They are traversing a decaying forest, an abandoned village and reach a mountain path. Rocky and steep, high it climbs. This is a chance for players to talk to each other and bond.

It is recommended to come up with a custom story how players were captured in the caravan. In order to prevent them from escaping, guards and Kobolds can keep a close eye and the dragon in the sky should be a scary alternative.

For the story purposes, there are specific roles, dedicated to some of the players.
# Mystryl Guided
The dead god of magic chooses one of the PCs to guide to [[The Temple of First Creation]] in order to fix the world. 

For the first run of this one-shot, that PC was also an accidental time traveler, that scanned a QR code in [[The Temple Core]]. This is an optional detail and can be replaced with a straight-forward spell, carved in stone. ^mystyl-optional-timetraveler
# Agent
One of the PCs is an agent of [[Zuldrakar]]. They are wearing a collar that binds them to the dragonlich. Their goal is to reach [[The Temple Core]], but they do not possess information either over their master or temple purpose.
