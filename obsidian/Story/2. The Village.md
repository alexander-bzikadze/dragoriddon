## Map
![[2. The Village.jpg]]
# Hiding Spot
Villagers are hiding in a wine cellar under Elder's Residence. With Perception DC 12, players can hear muffled whispers of the villagers. That will give an advantage to find the hidden entrance to the cellar (DC 15).

Eldrin and [[Myra]] are going to get into the conversation with players if that happens.
# Camping
If players do not find the villagers and camp in the village, villagers will try to ambush them. Depending on player's precautions, villagers may restrain players in fishing [net](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/net) (if players did not take it from fisherman's hut) DC 10. After 1 round, villagers will tie players with a [rope](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/rope-hempen-50-feet) DC 17. In this case, players will receive one point of exhaustion.

In case players were cautious enough or found the villagers, no negative effect is suffered.

In case of a confrontation, villagers will not attack, but will try to run away.
```encounter
name: Village butchering
creatures:
  - 10: Commoner
```
# Morning Attack
In the morning, Loriel, who has been keeping watch, will spot and alert the village. If villagers are dead, no external alert comes. A horde of undead is coming to the village.
## Quiet Leave
>[!tip]- Recommended Music
>[[music/Index#^the-hunted|The Hunted by Skye Lewin and Michael Salvatori]]

Players choose to leave the village to its doom. Depending on where they are sleeping, for each building that they pass, Stealth DC 12. If total failures exceed 5, players are spotted. They can still run, thought. Regardless, the villagers, if they survive, will remember players choice.
## Protect the Village
>[!tip]- Recommended Music
>[[music/Index#^the-bastard|The Bastard by Ramin Djawadi]]

Players choose to stay and fight while villagers escape. They need to withstand 8 rounds in total. Each round gives time for some of the villagers to escape.

On round 9, Jorin the Fisherman dwarf is wounded, frightened and paralyzed by [a nightwalker](https://explorednd.com/gameplay/nightwalker-5e-guide/#Question_How_Tall_is_a_Nightwalker). Only if players spend an action to carry him out, Jorin survives.

>[!tip] Role Playing Advice
Zombies are not intelligent and attack the nearest target. They can easily create walls that harden movement for players and themselves. As they surpass in numbers, they can also try to grapple and shove players to gain advantage on melee attacks.
>
>Will-o'-Wisp on the other hand can move through allies and enemies and should use that opportunity.
```yaml
- []
- ['Myra']
- ['Brielle', 'Eris']
- ['Loriel', 'Terold']
- []
- ['Tilda', 'Lenna', 'Horace']
- ['Eldrin']
- ['Jorin']
```
```encounter-table
name: First wave (joins immediately)
creatures:
  - 5: Zombie

name: Second wave (joins at round 2)
creatures:

name: Third wave (joins at round 4)

---
name: Forth wave (joins at round 6)
creatures:
  - 5: Zombie
---
name: From afar (joins at round 8)
creatures:
  - Nightwalker

```
If players run out of enemies, either Will-o'-Wisps or Zombies can be added to the encounter.

The horde is moving slow, so once players are out of the encounter, they can safely leave the scene.

> Note: Lorien's partner Jorin has smaller chances to survive, which can be exploited depending on player's decisions for emotional scenes.
# Aftermatch
Surviving villagers will ignite to head to a nearby town despite it being ruled by the dragons, as there is no better place to be protected. The journey will take 3 days, but for time reasons only will have specific events.

On the first camping day the villagers will use what they can find to set up a campfire and beds. They also have some food and it is up to the players to share if they have any.
## Jorin & Loriel
### Jorin did not survive
>[!tip]- Recommended Music
>[[music/Index#^ocean-eyes|Ocean Eyes by Billie Eilish, cover by Chris KlÃ¤fford]]

Loriel, visibly saddened, will approach the party. She'll ask for their help to commemorate Jorin. She'll lead them to a nearby clearing where she places a small trinket or a carved stone in memory of him. As a touching gesture, she might hum or sing a soft lullaby that Jorin used to love. Players can share their condolences or even share a short tale of loss from their own backgrounds.
### Jorin survived
>[!tip]- Recommended music
>Campfire

Grateful for Jorin's rescue, [[Jorin & Loriel]] invite for short camp drinks. Jorin has a small flask of spiced wine with him. They will tell a few stories.

A funny story of  Jorin and Loriel's first date.
>_"You know,"_ Loriel begins, his cheeks reddening just a tad, _"When Jorin and I were just starting to get to know each other, Jorin wanted to impress me. And what better way than by showcasing his 'impeccable' fishing skills? He had a grand idea to catch the biggest fish in the stream to win my heart."_
>
>Jorin interjects with a chuckle, _"Rather than using a conventional rod, I thought I'd be innovative and use a net. However, in my haste, I used some of my... well, less-used undergarments, thinking Loriel wouldn't notice. And he didn't... until the net snagged on a submerged rock. When I pulled, not only did the net rip, revealing its... unconventional makeup, but I also lost my balance, dragging both of us into the cold water!"_
>
>Loriel laughs, _"It was... an unconventional first impression. Instead of being swept off my feet by a big fish, I was swept into the water with this big fool. But I must admit, it made me fall for him even faster, knowing he'd go to such lengths just to see me smile."_

A grim story of a lost child of the village, who drowned in the nearby stream.
>Loriel's expression turns somber as he narrates, _"Many moons ago, a young child from our village, full of curiosity, ventured too close to the rapid stream after a storm. The banks were slippery, and the current strong. The child was swept away. The entire village searched downstream for days, but the river's embrace is often unyielding. We never found the child. It serves as a painful reminder of nature's unpredictable power and the care we must take with our young ones."_

An epic legend from the village's history of how elders created an illusion of an impregnable city to scare off orc raiders.
>Jorin takes a deep breath, his voice filled with pride and reverence. _"Long before our time, our village faced an unprecedented danger. A horde of marauding orcs threatened to wipe out our community. But our elders, few in number and advanced in age, didn't flee. They used their combined wisdom and magic, creating a grand illusion. The entire village appeared as a fortified city with towering walls and legions of armed soldiers."_
>
> _"The orcs, believing they were outmatched, retreated. By the time the illusion faded, our village was safe, and our elders, exhausted from their efforts, became legendary figures. They proved that true strength isn't just in one's arm but in one's mind and heart."_
## Tilda's Nightmare
The camp is settled, with most of the group deep in sleep. Suddenly, a piercing scream from Tilda breaks the silence. She's drenched in sweat, eyes wide in terror, having experienced a vivid nightmare of the undead attacking the village again.

This draws concern from the group. Players can offer comfort, perhaps by sharing stories of their own fears, singing a soothing song, or using some magic to help her go back to sleep.

Lenna, her mother, will whisper her thanks if a player calms her daughter, sharing a brief comment on how Tilda has been particularly affected by the recent events and how she used to be filled with joy and laughter.
# Mystryl Warning
During the journey, the pc from the future will receive a message
```
Temple soars once more,
Above despair and dark skies,
Spring draws near each step.
