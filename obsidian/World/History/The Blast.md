[[The Eldritch Conclave]] formed an alliance with the [[the Dawn Siblings]]. In exchange for assassinating [[Pyrrhexis]], they pledged to aid the Siblings in infiltrating the festival. For centuries, [[the Dawn Siblings]] held the secret to detonating dragon eggs. By smuggling corrupted eggs into the capital, they triggered a nuclear explosion, setting off a chain reaction that killed many dragons and mortals alike. [[The Eldritch Conclave]] were left horrified by the devastation they had inadvertently helped cause.

This cataclysmic event did not go unnoticed, and the veil separating the living from the dead was torn asunder. The fabric of space-time began to intertwine, sending objects to different times and places.

[[The Eldritch Conclave]] now yearn for redemption and, if possible, a way to retain their power. [[The Dawn Siblings]] would rather see all life perish than relinquish control to the dragons. Meanwhile, [[Zuldrakar]], who was the one to reveale the secret of nuclear weaponry to the Siblings, seeks the end of all things, hoping to reshape the world populated only by the undead.
