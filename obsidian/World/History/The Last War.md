Tiamat was released from Avernus, gathered her forces, and waged an all-out war against the gods. One of her generals, [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md), betrayed and consumed her. He bent other dragons to his will, devouring gods until none remained alive. The demise of the gods, and especially Tiamat, caused reproductive challenges. [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md), despite being the most powerful entity in the world, did not gain divine power. For eons, dragons required a divine will for birth, and it was Tiamat who decided which creature would emerge from an egg: a kobold, a dragon, or some other draconic entity. Eventually, [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md) found a solution to this conundrum.

Determined to achieve true divinity, [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md) instituted a festival of sacrifices. By momentarily touching divinity, she aimed to breathe life into dragon eggs. By creating a sufficient number of dragons, she could then sacrifice them in his quest for godhood.
