All heroes are prisoners, led to their doom by a dragon captor. They are traversing a decaying forest, an abandoned village and reach a mountain path. Rocky and steep, high it climbs. This is a chance for players to talk to each other and bond.

Finally, they reach a plateau where they can watch where they are meant to be executed. Seconds before [[The Blast]] destroys it.
