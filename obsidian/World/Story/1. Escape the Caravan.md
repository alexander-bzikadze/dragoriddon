The players are `blinded` by [[The Blast]] for a minute, in which [[Dralenthis]] cries in fear and escapes. A minute later a deafening sound leaves the caravan in chaos. Prisoners start to escape and guards try to cut everyone down.
# Freeing Yourself
To escape, players must succeed on a check (depending on how they escape) of DC 10. Common examples:
* Breaking the chain -- Athletics
* Squeeze out -- Sleight of hand
* Find a weakness -- Investigation
If player fails, they have disadvantage on attack rolls and cannot take any cart related actions. However, they don't need to roll again as on the second turn they will break free.
# Caravan Structure
The caravan is structured in the following manner. there are six carts, first and last are reinforced with more guards then others. Each cart is dragged by prisoners and contains some gifts to [[Pyrrhexis]]. In order to obtain those goods, players must spent some number of actions.

Players are dragging the last cart. Each 4 turns, guards up front will join the encounter as they finish off the prisoners they are guarding. Players have a choice to willingly move towards carts ahead, then those guards will join sooner.

If players decide to escape, they will only be pursuit for 100 feet.

# After Escape
Recommended Music: [Forest by Akira Yamaoka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZhvK0lZFxo)

The once verdant mountain passage shows signs of distress. Trees have charred branches, some leaves have an unnatural hue, and there's a peculiar stillness to the air. Occasionally, you might spot wildlife with erratic behavior or notice that the patterns of bird migrations have been disrupted.

If players search, they might find
- Herbal plants that can be used for basic healing or crafting potions (DC Survival 12 if not proficient).
- A fresh water spring trickling down the mountainside.
- Flint stones useful for starting fires.
## Optional Encounter
Hidden amidst the wild shrubs and rocks, the players (player with highest passive perception) spot a direwolf, her massive form lying protectively atop a small burrowed hole. Upon closer inspection, it's evident that she's gravely injured, her once-fierce eyes now clouded with pain -- she probably ran into something during [[The Blast]]. Faint, whimpering sounds emerge from the hole beneath her, indicating the presence of a surviving pup.

The direwolf, though weakened, still shows a protective streak, growling softly if anyone gets too close. However, gentle and cautious approaches, such as offering food or using soothing words, can calm her (DC 12 to become friendly, DC 6 to stop being hostile; depending on how players choose to play this out). Players can choose to heal her or help extract the pup from beneath her. 

If players manage to calm the direwolf, she slowly shifts, revealing the entrance to the hole. A small, fearful pup emerges, its fur mottled with patches of dirt. Should they heal the direwolf, she nods in gratitude, gingerly taking her pup in her jaws and disappearing into the wilderness. If they only assist with the pup and leave the direwolf be, she offers a final, mournful howl before her strength ebbs away, entrusting her pup to the players with a resigned, thankful gaze.
# Mystryl Warning
By the end of the day, the prisoner from the future will receive the following message on their phone.
```
In village, silence.
Follow the wind till dawn strikes, 
A lone leaf falls down.
---
В деревне тишина, 
До рассвета следуй ветру, 
Лист опадает один.
```
