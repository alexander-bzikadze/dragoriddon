The world is shattered Faer√ªn. No one truly remembers what exactly transpired, but the entirety of the known world is now under the yoke of dragons. The gods have been defeated, and all planes save for the Material have been destroyed. The most powerful and dominant of the modern dragons, [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md), is said to have devoured the gods and assimilated their power.

For several centuries, dragons have held an annual festival where mortals are sacrificed. These mortals are brought by other, older dragons as tribute to [Pyrrhexis](Pyrrhexis.md). You are one of such captives.

Despite the demise of the gods and other extraplanar entities, divine and warlock magic still exists. However, it is illegal and heavily persecuted. The presence of magic amongst mortals is more of a rarity than a norm.

The majority of mortals have resigned themselves to their subordinate status, and cities are often adapted for the residence of dragon aristocracy.
