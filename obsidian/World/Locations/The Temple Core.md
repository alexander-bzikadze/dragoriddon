The Temple Core is the heart of [[The Temple of First Creation]]. It is where Mystryl created magic. It is located under the temple main structure and can only be accessed through the control room when temple is activated and in the sky.

The core is ancient structure, with light produced by luminescent mushrooms. The main altar is preceded by a tunnel, guarded by a sphinx. The altar has either the spell carved out of the stone or a QR code that leads to the words of the spell to open the fabric of reality. That depends on the story option for [[0. Prologue#^mystyl-optional-timetraveler|a PC to be a time traveler]].
