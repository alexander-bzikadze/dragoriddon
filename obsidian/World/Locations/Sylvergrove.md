Sylvergrove, named after the shimmering silver willow trees native to its valley, was once a thriving village with a mystical aura. At its heart stood the Moonheart well that travelers would throw silver to make wishes.

However, under the rule of dragons, things changed. With these mighty creatures dominating the skies, the once-safe paths to Sylvergrove became treacherous. Trade slowed, travelers and adventurers became rare, and the village began its decline. The well was desecrated and rebuilt plainly by the citizens. The once-lush valley now holds remnants of its former glory, with hope in the villagers' hearts that someday, peace will return and the decay will be reversed.
