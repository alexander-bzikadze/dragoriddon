Sylvergrove, named after the shimmering silver willow trees native to its valley, was once a thriving village with a mystical aura. At its heart stood the Moonheart Tree, a symbol of unity and prosperity. The village prospered, and its "Moonleaf Festival" was a renowned midsummer event.

However, under the rule of dragons, things changed. With these mighty creatures dominating the skies, the once-safe paths to Sylvergrove became treacherous. Trade slowed, travelers and adventurers became rare, and the village began its decline. The once-lush valley now holds remnants of its former glory, with hope in the villagers' hearts that someday, peace will return and the decay will be reversed.
