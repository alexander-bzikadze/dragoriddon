The Celestial Chalice Tavern has been in [[Laelia]]'s family for generations. Passed down from her ancestors, it was always renowned for its unique celestial ambiance. [[Laelia]], having inherited the tavern, kept its traditions alive and added her own touch, enhancing its allure. She preserved its tales, stories of celestial events, and the ancient significance of the celestial chalice, making the tavern a beloved spot for scholars, adventurers, and locals.

The Celestial Chalice Tavern is a venerable establishment with interiors adorned in celestial motifs. Its main hall, illuminated by soft, ethereal glows from luminescent crystals, feels like being under a starlit night sky. The bar, made of dark wood with gleaming moon and star inlays, invites patrons to enjoy their drinks, while the plush, velvet cushioned seating areas provide comfort. The main wall features a mural of a celestial chalice, overflowing with starlight.
