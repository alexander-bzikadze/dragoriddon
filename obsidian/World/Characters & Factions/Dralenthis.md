# Biography
Born as a result of [[Pyrrhexis]]'s grand festival, Dralenthis always struggled to fit into the dragon society that he was thrust into. While he respected the might and power of the elder dragons, especially [[Pyrrhexis]], he felt a deep-rooted desire to carve his own path and identity. This inner turmoil was compounded by an inherent timidity, which often saw him hesitating in conflicts and seeking easier routes to achieve his objectives. He has a penchant for rebelling against established norms, though he does so subtly due to his cowardly nature.
# Character
Dralenthis is a curious blend of youthful rebellion and innate cowardice. While he is eager to challenge the status quo and prove himself, he often hesitates to act out of fear of retribution. His desires are to establish his own legacy and perhaps find allies who share his perspective. His major strengths are his quick wit and agility. However, his fearful nature and reluctance to commit to a cause often hinder his endeavors.
