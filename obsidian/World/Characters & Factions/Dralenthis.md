# Biography
Born as a result of [[Pyrrhexis]]'s grand festival, Dralenthis always struggled to fit into the dragon society that he was thrust into. While he respected the might and power of the elder dragons, especially [[Pyrrhexis]], he felt a deep-rooted desire to carve his own path and identity. This inner turmoil was compounded by an inherent timidity, which often saw him hesitating in conflicts and seeking easier routes to achieve his objectives. He has a penchant for rebelling against established norms, though he does so subtly due to his cowardly nature.
