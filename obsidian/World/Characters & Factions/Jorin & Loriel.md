# Biography
Both of them have been born in [[Sylvergrove]] and lived their whole lives. When they were just starting their relationship, Jorin, trying to impress Loriel, decided to show off his 'superior' fishing skills. Instead of using a traditional rod, Jorin decided to use a net, made somewhat comically from his undergarments. While trying to catch a big fish to win Loriel's heart, the net snagged on a rock, causing both of them to tumble into the cold water. Loriel, finding humor and love in this unconventional approach, started warming up to Jorin even faster.

Today Jorin continues as the village's fisherman whereas Loriel spends time carving stone as a hobby.
