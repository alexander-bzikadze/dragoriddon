>[!info] The Dawn Siblings
>*The Dawn Siblings are a resistance faction aiming to overthrow the draconic rule of Pyrrhexis and restore balance to Faer没n, armed with the volatile secret of dragon eggs.*
# Overview
A resistance faction formed in direct opposition to the draconic rule of [[Pyrrhexis]] and other dominating entities, The Dawn Siblings signify a new hope and rebirth for the world of Faer没n. The group takes its name both from its founders, a set of siblings bound by blood and purpose, and from their collective mission to usher in a new "dawn" or era for the world.
# Goal
The primary mission of The Dawn Siblings is to dismantle the tyrannical rule of [[Pyrrhexis]] and restore balance to the world. They are prepared to work relentlessly towards this goal and make sacrifices along the way. The dragons must be destroyed at any cost.
# Members
While the core leadership is made up of the eponymous siblings, the faction has expanded to include a diverse group of warriors, mages, scholars, and other individuals disillusioned with the draconic reign. Their ranks are open to all who share their vision of a renewed Faer没n.
# Relationships
- **[[Pyrrhexis]]**: Naturally, they are in direct opposition to [[Pyrrhexis]], working both overtly and covertly to undermine his rule and gather information on her plans and weaknesses.
- **[[The Eldritch Conclave]]**: A complicated relationship. While both groups share the goal of overthrowing [[Pyrrhexis]], their visions for the aftermath are vastly different. Temporary alliances are possible, but trust is thin.
- **[[Zuldrakar]]**: The relationship with the dragonlich [[Zuldrakar]] is one of disdain and mistrust. However, both parties recognize the might of [[Pyrrhexis]] and, in their shared objective to overthrow her, can find themselves in reluctant, temporary alliances.
- **Other Factions and Groups**: The Dawn Siblings have cultivated numerous alliances with smaller resistance cells, guilds, and organizations throughout Faer没n. They also engage in diplomatic relations with neutral factions, aiming to sway them towards their cause.
# Notable Achievements
Over the years, they have managed several covert operations leading to the liberation of towns and cities. They've also been instrumental in safeguarding knowledge by establishing underground libraries and arcane schools. One of their most daring feats was the theft of dragon eggs, aiming to learn more about the draconic lifecycle and possibly disrupt [[Pyrrhexis]]'s plans. [[Zuldrakar]], in a surprising twist, shared with them the volatile, atomic bomb nature of these dragon eggs, a revelation that would shape many of their subsequent strategies.
