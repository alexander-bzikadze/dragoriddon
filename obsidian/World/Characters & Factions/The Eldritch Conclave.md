>[!info] The Eldritch Conclave
>*An assembly of ancient dragons seeking to reclaim power and overthrow [[Pyrrhexis]].*
# Background
The Eldritch Conclave is a clandestine assembly of the most ancient and sagacious dragons of Faer√ªn. These ancient beings remember the world before the dominion of [[Pyrrhexis]], and many of them once held territories, hoards, and veneration that rivaled that of minor deities. Over time, [[Pyrrhexis]]' rise to power threatened their ancient status quo, leading some of them to begrudgingly bend the knee to his new order, while others faded into obscurity.
# Goals
1. **Regain Former Glory**: At their core, the members of the Eldritch Conclave seek to reclaim their old territories and the reverence they once enjoyed from various races.
2. **Overthrow [[Pyrrhexis]]**: While they recognize [[Pyrrhexis]]'s power, especially after she betrayed and consumed Tiamat, they yearn for the day her reign ends, hoping to fill the power vacuum left in his wake.
3. **Preserve Draconic Legacy**: Despite their treacherous plans, the Conclave genuinely wishes to ensure the survival and prosperity of draconic species. They recognize the importance of solving the divine birthright issue but envision a solution less tyrannical than [[Pyrrhexis]]'s sacrificial festivals.
## Relationships
1. **[[Pyrrhexis]]**: Their relationship with [[Pyrrhexis]] is complicated. While many of the Eldritch Conclave despise her for the new world order she's created, a few secretly admire her audacity and power. However, the majority see her as a threat to their very way of life and heritage.
2. [[The Dawn Siblings]]: Initially, the Eldritch Conclave viewed [[the Dawn Siblings]] as useful tools, striking a clandestine deal with them to further their own goals. However, the catastrophic event in the capital led to a rift, with the dragons horrified by the sheer scale of destruction caused by the atomic explosion.
3. **[[Zuldrakar]]**: The Eldritch Conclave is wary of [[Zuldrakar]]. Some members even believe that his goal to reshape the world with the undead is more dangerous than [[Pyrrhexis]]'s reign.
4. **Mortal Races**: Most members of the Eldritch Conclave view mortals as beneath them, mere pawns in their larger schemes. However, a few older dragons, having witnessed countless civilizations rise and fall, hold a certain respect for the tenacity and potential of mortal beings.
# Influence and Resources
The Eldritch Conclave is formidable. Each member has a hoard accumulated over millennia, filled with powerful artifacts, vast wealth, and arcane knowledge. Moreover, the combined ancient magic of its members is a force to be reckoned with. In the shadows, they also maintain networks of spies and informants, primarily composed of younger dragons and dragon-enthralled mortals, ensuring they always have eyes and ears across the realm.
# Hierarchy
The Eldritch Conclave doesn't have a strict hierarchy, given that its members are all ancient dragons who value their independence. However, decisions are typically made in vast clandestine gatherings, with the most persuasive and influential dragons often swaying the collective's direction.
