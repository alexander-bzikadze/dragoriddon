With an insatiable hunger for power and dominance, she journeyed through the lands, amassing knowledge, arcane energy, and followers. It's said she confronted the gods themselves, devouring them and assimilating their unmatched might. Over the centuries, she solidified her reign, transforming the once-diverse world of Faerûn into a dragon-dominated realm, obliterating most other planes of existence.

She's cunning, incredibly intelligent, and possesses a tactical acumen that's unparalleled.
